## Hi :)
I am a high school junior at Francis Parker School in San Diego, CA. My dad is an electrical engineer, so I've been exposed to electronics pretty much my entire life. My dad taught me to solder when I was 3, and I started playing with actual circuits around the age of 6.

## Projects I'm Working On

### SinESC
My main project, currently. I got into FPV drones a few years ago to satisfy my general affinity for things that fly, and I wanted to use my electronics and PCB design skills to improve the hobby rather than just buying pre-made parts (which got boring pretty fast). I started looking at ways to increase flight times, and learned that the electronic speed controllers (ESCs) everyone uses employ a simple but inefficient drive technique. I decided to bring Field-Oriented Control (FOC) to the hobby, and that's when I created SinESC. If you want the details about how SinESC differs from other ESCs, the repository is below. Otherwise, just know that the whole point of SinESC is to improve efficiency and smoothness, both of which are extremely important to any drone pilot.

### Universal Laser Driver
TBA
