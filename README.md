## Hi :)

I am a high school junior at Francis Parker School in San Diego, CA. My dad is an electrical engineer, so I've been curious about electronics for pretty much my entire life. My dad taught me to solder when I was 3, and I started playing with actual circuits around the age of 6.

I started with the basic analog building blocks like transistors and op-amps, and soon moved to 4000-series logic chips. I spent a lot of time with the 555 timer as well. I soon moved on to FM and infrared audio transmitters, and I got my first power supply and oscilloscope. Notice how I haven't yet mentioned the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I didn't touch either of those until 2017! And when I finally did, I felt confident because of my solid analog background knowledge. I didn't use the Arduino or the Pi to learn electronics, I instead used them as tools with which I could build more complex projects easily and quickly. And I think anyone who wants to become serious about electronics should do the sameâ€”start with the basic analog stuff and use the Pi and Arduino as mere tools.

With college apps coming up soon, I definitely have a long way to go. But I've come pretty far since 2010. Here is an overview of what I've been working on recently:

### SinESC
(details TBA)

### Universal Laser Driver
(details TBA)
