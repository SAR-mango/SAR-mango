## About Me
Hi! I am an Electrical Engineering student at UCSB. I enjoy projects involving embedded hardware, power electronics, lasers, and RC drones and planes.

## Projects

### SinESC
A modern ESC for FPV drones that uses field-oriented control for significantly improved efficiency over standard ESCs. Full details are in the repository.

### Universal Laser Driver
Solves the problem of having to match batteries, laser drivers, and diodes based on input and output voltage and current requirements.

### eApprox
Algorithm I came up with to approximate e and e^x. I wrote this in python while taking a break from studying for finals, but rewrote it in C as a learning exercise and to make it run faster.
