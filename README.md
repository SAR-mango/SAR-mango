## About Me
Hi! I'm an electrical engineering student at UCSB, and I enjoy projects involving power electronics, embedded systems, lasers, and RC aircraft. Below are short descriptions of some of my projects; feel free to check out their repositories for more details. If you find anything interesting or have questions/comments, contact me! esampat@ucsb.edu

## Projects
### SinESC
A modern ESC for FPV drones that uses field-oriented control for significantly improved efficiency over standard ESCs.

### Universal Laser Driver
Solves the problem of having to match batteries, laser drivers, and laser diodes based on input and output voltage and current requirements.

### eApprox
Algorithm to approximate e<sup>x</sup>, implemented in C. Results graphed with Matplotlib.
